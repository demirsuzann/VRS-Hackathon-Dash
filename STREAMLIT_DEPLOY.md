## **Quick Deployment Steps (5 minutes)**

### **Step 1: Install Streamlit Locally (Optional - to test)**

First, make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed:
- Download from https://www.python.org/downloads/
- **IMPORTANT**: Check "Add Python to PATH" during installation

Then in PowerShell:
```powershell
cd "c:\Users\demir\Projects\VRS Hackathon"
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```

This will open the dashboard at `http://localhost:8501`

### **Step 2: Push to GitHub**

If you haven't already:

```powershell
cd "c:\Users\demir\Projects\VRS Hackathon"
git add .
git commit -m "Add Streamlit version of Dino Keeper Dashboard"
git push origin main
```

If this is your first time with GitHub:
1. Go to https://github.com
2. Create account
3. Create new repo: `dino-keeper-dashboard`
4. Then run:
```powershell
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/dino-keeper-dashboard.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### **Step 3: Deploy to Streamlit Cloud**

1. Go to **https://streamlit.io/cloud**
2. Click **"Deploy an app"**
3. Choose **"GitHub"** as your source
4. Select your repository: `dino-keeper-dashboard`
5. Select branch: `main`
6. Set main file path: `app.py`
7. Click **"Deploy!"**

**That's it!** ðŸŽ‰

## **Your Live URL**

After deployment, you'll get a URL like:
```
https://dino-keeper-dashboard.streamlit.app
```

Share this with anyone - they can access it from anywhere!

---

## **Update the QR Code**

In `app.py`, update this line with your actual Streamlit URL:
```python
qr_url = "https://dino-keeper-dashboard.streamlit.app"
```

Then commit and push - it auto-deploys!
